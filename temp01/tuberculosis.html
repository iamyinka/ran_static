                                    What many people know: Tuberculosis (TB), formerly also known as "consumption", is
                                    an infectious bacterial disease that
                                    primarily affects the lungs and, if left untreated, can lead to death.

                                    What many do not know: Although TB has long been considered "defeated", it still
                                    represents a huge health problem.
                                    Because it is still the most common killing infectious disease in the world.
                                    According to reliable estimates, every
                                    third person is infected with the pathogen, the mycobacterium tuberculosis.

                                    Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium (mycobacterium
                                    tuberculosis). The pathogen was
                                    discovered by Robert Koch in 1882 and is very similar to that of leprosy. Untreated,
                                    TB disease leads to death in half
                                    of all patients in less than two years. Along with HIV / AIDS, TB is one of the most
                                    common killer infectious diseases
                                    worldwide. It is the most common for AIDS patients

                                <p>
                                    The infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis usually takes
                                    place as a droplet infection via the
                                    respiratory tract with the formation of a "primary complex" in the lungs. Or
                                    to put it simply: tuberculosis spreads from
                                    person to person through the air. When people with pulmonary tuberculosis
                                    cough, sneeze, or spit, they throw TB bacteria
                                    into the air. A person only has to inhale a few of these germs to become
                                    infected.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    If the immune system is intact, the tuberculosis pathogens can survive in the body
                                    for decades without the disease
                                    breaking out. During this so-called latent infection, those affected are not
                                    contagious. But there is a constant risk
                                    that the disease will turn into active tuberculosis if the immune system is weakened
                                    - for example due to
                                    undernourishment or malnutrition, poor hygiene conditions, sustained high levels of
                                    exertion or stress or serious
                                    illnesses. Many of these factors interact with poverty, which is why TB is
                                    considered “poverty associated” and affects
                                    the most vulnerable groups in society
                                </p>

                                    The combination of HIV and TB is particularly dangerous: If an HIV-positive patient
                                    comes into contact with TB bacteria,
                                    they will contract TB much more often than a person without HIV infection. At the
                                    same time, TB causes an HIV infection
                                    to progress faster. The diagnosis is often made very late because the HIV infection
                                    makes the diagnosis of TB very
                                    difficult. TB is a leading cause of death in people infected with HIV.

                                    The globally standardized therapy for tuberculosis disease consists of taking
                                    isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and
                                    pyrazinamide for at least six months - ethambutol and pyrazinamide of which,
                                    however, only in the first two months. In
                                    2010, the WHO issued new treatment guidelines for the treatment of
                                    multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. TB therapy is free
                                    of charge in most countries. However, because of the disease, the patients often
                                    have no income and still often have to
                                    bear costs such as medication for side effects or transport to the health station.
                                    Therefore, some patients cannot
                                    afford the therapy or they stop the treatment before it is finished. However, this
                                    increases the risk that TB will
                                    develop into a resistant form (see Resistance in tuberculosis). Again and again,
                                    however, it is errors on the part of
                                    the national health systems that are responsible for the interrupted use of
                                    medication and thus for the risk of
                                    resistance developing.

                                    It is assumed that without treatment, every third person affected will die of
                                    tuberculosis after months or years. One in
                                    two survivors retains permanent lung damage or damage to other organs. A renewed
                                    outbreak of the disease in patients who
                                    have not been fully treated is possible at any time as soon as the immune system is
                                    weakened again.

                                    bacteria have been killed, the
                                    surviving bacteria develop resistance to the drugs. The drugs are thus ineffective.
                                    According to the World Health
                                    Organization WHO, around 500,000 people developed resistant tuberculosis in 2019.

                                <p>
                                    As a result, TB patients affected by resistance have to take special, often less
                                    effective drugs with mostly serious
                                    side effects. The therapy time is also extended from six months to up to two years.
                                    These drugs are also often
                                    significantly more expensive. If this therapy is not carried out to the end, the
                                    pathogens develop further resistances,
                                    whereby the choice of effective alternative drugs (“second line”) and thus the
                                    chance of a successful treatment are

                                    certain forms of TB in young children (such as tuberculous meningitis). So, it does

                                    Although treatable, tuberculosis (TB) is still one of the top ten causes of death
                                    worldwide. According to estimates by
                                    the World Health Organization, around 1.4 million people died of TB in 2019, and
                                    around 10 million were newly diagnosed
                                    in the same year, including around 1.2 million children. People with a weakened
                                    immune system are particularly at risk.
                                    A third of the world's population - two billion people, i.e. about one in three! -
                                    is infected with the TB bacterium,
                                    but most of them will never get sick.

                                <p>
                                    Most of the TB cases occur in the populous countries of Asia. But also, in many
                                    countries in southern Africa,
                                    tuberculosis is still a widespread disease that costs many lives. Unfortunately,
                                    there has been a special development
                                    for years in the countries of the former Soviet Union: Fewer people fall ill here,
                                    but 20 to 50 percent of diagnosed
                                    patients have difficult-to-treat resistant tuberculosis (as of 2019).

                                    The data published each year by WHO in the Global Tuberculosis Report is based on
                                    figures reported by national TB
                                    control programs or ministries of health. But these are not always actually
                                    registered cases: Because many national
                                    health systems are poorly equipped and there is a lack of qualified medical staff,
                                    it is often not all sick people who
                                    are recorded and extrapolations for the statistics are made on the basis of our own
                                    studies.

                                <p>
                                    If antibiotics are not taken regularly or if antibiotic therapy is stopped before
                                    all bacteria have been killed, the
                                    surviving bacteria develop resistance to the drugs. The drugs are thus ineffective.
                                    According to the World Health
                                    Organization WHO, around 500,000 people contracted multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis
                                    in 2018.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As a result, TB patients affected by resistance have to take special, often less
                                    effective drugs with mostly serious
                                    side effects. The therapy time is also extended from six months to up to two years.
                                    These drugs are also often
                                    significantly more expensive. If this therapy is not carried out to the end, the
                                    pathogens develop further resistances,
                                    whereby the choice of effective alternative drugs (“second line”) and thus the
                                    chance of a successful treatment are
                                    considerably reduced.

                                    In addition to the resistance of the MDR-TB, bacterial strains of the XDR-TB also
                                    have resistance to the drug group of
                                    the so-called fluoroquinolones. As a result, the choice of substitute drugs is
                                    extremely limited.

                                <p>
                                    Many of the alternative drugs are expensive due to their existing patent protection
                                    and unaffordable for most people in
                                    developing countries. Side effects occur often and severely, for example severe
                                    damage to the nervous system or hearing
                                    damage or even deafness.

                                    Diagnosing resistant TB is also very complex and expensive. In developing countries
                                    there are only a few laboratories
                                    that can clearly identify isoniazid resistance in MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Many patients
                                    die during MDR treatment, which lasts
                                    up to two years, because the bacteria had additional resistance in the sense of
                                    XDR-TB.

                                    In addition, there may be resistance to alternative drugs. The affected patients can
                                    only hope that the new drugs being
                                    researched will soon be fully developed and tested ( see “Research” fact sheet ).
                                    However, the often poorly trained
                                    health systems in developing and emerging countries will not be able to provide
                                    these expensive but life-saving drugs.
                                    For example, tuberculosis can cost those affected by poverty their lives.

                                    Tuberculosis (TB) has long been a neglected disease, meaning insufficient resources
                                    have been invested in research. Only
                                    a few years ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) sounded the alarm: If nothing
                                    more is done about TB immediately,
                                    the disease can no longer be treated - because the pathogen is becoming less and
                                    less sensitive to the few antibiotics
                                    available. According to the WHO Global Tuberculosis Report, around 500,000 people
                                    contracted multi-drug-resistant
                                    tuberculosis in 2019 alone. The number of unreported cases is probably many times
                                    higher, since in many places it is not
                                    yet possible to diagnose resistant TB ( see fact sheet “Resistance” ).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The new awareness has already set things in motion: Increasing investments are being
                                    made in the development of reliable
                                    rapid tests, for example in the “GeneXpert”. The WHO has recommended this for the
                                    diagnosis of TB since 2010. It shows
                                    within hours whether a person is infected with TB and at the same time shows whether
                                    the pathogen is resistant to the
                                    most important antibiotic rifampicin. In the projects of RedAid Nigeria, this
                                    diagnostic method is often used.

                                <p><strong>New drugs - but not for everyone</strong></p>

                                <p>
                                    There has also been progress in the treatment of TB patients: two new drugs have
                                    been approved for the treatment of
                                    tuberculosis since 2014, Bedaquiline and Delaminid. Another drug, Pretomanid, was
                                    developed by the non-profit
                                    organization “TB Alliance” and approved in 2019 for the treatment of extremely
                                    resistant tuberculosis. The drug
                                    clofazimin, known from the fight against leprosy, is also effective in TB - the
                                    pathogens causing leprosy and TB belong
                                    to the same bacterial strain. Studies are currently being carried out in various
                                    countries to find out in which
                                    combination the new drugs can be used in the shortest possible duration of
                                    treatment.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All of this gives hope. But viewed globally, not all people have access to the new
                                    drugs. Some of these drugs are very
                                    expensive. As long as health systems and patients in poor regions of the world
                                    cannot afford these drugs, tuberculosis
                                    will remain a disease of poverty and one of the world's greatest health problems.

                                    If the immune system is intact, these bacteria can survive in the body for decades

                                    Symptoms of the disease are persistent coughing, sometimes with bloody sputum,
                                    feeling weak, night sweats, fever, loss
                                    of appetite and weight loss. For many patients, this may initially be perceived as a
                                    cold. In addition, in many cases
                                    people in developing countries have no or only very limited access to health care.

                                    there can also be social reasons &mdash; for example the fear of stigmatization.

                                    The diagnosis of a TB infection can only be confirmed by the direct detection of
                                    tuberculosis bacteria, for example by
                                    microscopic examination of sputum (coughed up secretion of the airway mucous
                                    membrane). The relatively fast GeneXpert
                                    test method, the use of which is also recommended by the WHO, has been used more and
                                    more for a number of years: the
                                    molecular biological analyzer can also reliably detect a lower number of pathogens
                                    and at the same time identify simple
                                    (not multiple) resistances. It is therefore particularly suitable for people who are
                                    already suspected of having a
                                    resistant TB strain. Also in the projects of the RedAid/DAHW Deutsche Lepra- und
                                    Tuberkulosehilfe e. V., GeneXpert is
                                    being used more and more.

                                    However, TB diseases often go undetected at first because not enough bacteria have
                                    been coughed up. X-ray examinations
                                    can help with the diagnosis. Newer blood tests such as the gamma interferon test are
                                    also available. Although they are
                                    easy to use, they cannot differentiate between a pure infection with the TB pathogen
                                    and an outbreak of tuberculosis.

                                    The globally standardized therapy for tuberculosis disease consists of taking the
                                    four antibiotics rifampicin,
                                    isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for at least six months - the last two,
                                    however, only in the first two months. In
                                    2019, the WHO issued new treatment guidelines for the treatment of
                                    multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. TB therapy is free
                                    in most countries. However, because of the disease, the patients often have no
                                    income and still often have to bear costs
                                    such as medication for side effects or transport to the health station. Therefore,
                                    some patients cannot afford the
                                    therapy or they stop the treatment before it is finished. However, this increases
                                    the risk that TB will develop into a
                                    resistant form.

                                    Without treatment, one in three patients dies of tuberculosis, and one in two
                                    survivors retains permanent damage to
                                    their internal organs. A renewed outbreak of the disease in patients who have not
                                    been fully treated is possible at any
                                    time as soon as the immune system is weakened again.

                                    the World Health Organization, around 1.4 million people died of TB in 2019, and
                                    around 10 million were newly diagnosed
                                    in the same year, including around 1.2 million children.

                                    Most of the TB cases occur in the populous countries of Asia. But also, in many

                                    tuberculosis is still a widespread disease that costs many lives. Unfortunately,
                                    there has been a special development
                                    for years in the countries of the former Soviet Union: Fewer people fall ill here,
                                    but 20 to 50 percent of diagnosed
                                    patients have resistant tuberculosis that is difficult to treat (see fact sheet “TB
                                    Resistance”).

                                    The data published each year by WHO in the Global Tuberculosis Report is based on
                                    figures reported by national TB
                                    control programs or ministries of health. But these are not always actually
                                    registered cases: Because many national
                                    health systems are poorly equipped and there is a lack of qualified medical staff,
                                    it is often not all sick people who
                                    are recorded and extrapolations for the statistics are made on the basis of our own
                                    studies.

                                    The situation is particularly difficult in slums, refugee settlements or remote
                                    regions: Here people are often not
                                    registered at all, and access to health centers, which are usually kilometers away,
                                    is difficult or even impossible. Due
                                    to the massive diagnosis gap, the WHO assumes that around 30 percent of all TB cases
                                    worldwide (equivalent to around
                                    three million) in 2018 were not tested or diagnosed at all. Still a far too high
                                    number - but compared to the previous
                                    year with an "unreported figure" of around 40 percent, a positive trend that can be
                                    attributed to improvements in
                                    diagnostics, especially in India and Indonesia.
